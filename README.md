# AI-Project-CSE-30124: Text Editor with Autocorrect and Next Word Prediction

This project is a text editor built in Python, featuring autocorrect and next-word prediction functionalities. It consists of three main files:

## File Description

### autocorrect.py
- This file contains the `AutoCorrect` class, responsible for correcting spelling mistakes in real-time.
- It uses a variation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm to compute the distance between the user's misspelled word and all the possible words within one to two edits away.
- It uses a large corpus of text and counts the occurrences of every word in the text.
- These counts are used to compute probabilities to decide the most probable correction for the userâ€™s misspelled word.

### next-word.py
- This file includes the `TextProcessor` and `NextWordPredictor` classes.
- The `TextProcessor` class is used for reading and processing text data by tokenizing sentences and creating padded sequences.
- The `NextWordPredictor` class uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train an LSTM model for predicting the next word in a sentence.

### text-editor.py
- This file integrates `AutoCorrect` and `NextWordPredictor` into a GUI-based text editor using Tkinter.
- This file is the main interface for the text editor.
- When a user types a word incorrectly and then hits space, if the autocorrect found a word that the user more likely meant, it will automatically change the word to that.
- The next-word predictor will also run after the user hits space, and in a light gray font, it will show the suggested next word. The user can then hit tab to go with this suggested word, or continue typing to ignore this word.
